Twython Tools
=============

Command line scripts and tools for implementing Twython functions.

Incorporates functions from other Python libraries and modules,
including twython, requests, python-gnupg and foad.py.

Also uses GPG and Tor.

The scripts in python2/ are legacy scripts and only present for
reference.

The scripts in python3/ are what I use and are actively maintained.

The foad.py script is [available here](https://github.com/adversary-org/foad).

Python version specific information is in the Documentation/
directory.


# Contacting me

A minimised copy of my GPG key is in the Documentation/ directory
(ben-key-min.asc), this version does not include all the current
signatures.  Refreshing that key from the key servers will restore
those signatures.

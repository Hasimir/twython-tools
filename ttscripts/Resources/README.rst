Resources
=========

Similar purpose to InputFiles, but sometimes needs to be kept
separate.  Where InputFiles would be expected to change relatively
frequently, the Resources directory would be more consistently
unchanged or would not be cleared out during maintenance.

One common use for the Resources directory is to hold CSS files which
are used to generate images placed in the InputFiles/ directory prior
to a tweet posting them.
